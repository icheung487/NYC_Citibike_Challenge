# Overview: 
The purpose of this challenge was to utilize the NYC data to find trends that would help convince investors that a bike-sharing business is a solid business proposal for Des Moines. For this analysis, we needed to find trends based on time, gender, start and end time.  This would help us find possible similar trends to Des Moines and things to look out for when staring this business. 

# Results of Each Worsheet:
* Gender breakdown: 

  *  There are more males than females utilizing the bike-sharing program.  In the chart below, it's clear that there are more than 50% of customers that are male, which is a clear indication that more men tend to utilize the bike-sharing service.

* User Type: 
  * Most of the customers are subscribers which is key to knowing that we have returning customers.  Also, when looking at the gender breakdown, we know that men are our subscribera, which was obvious from the above gender breakdown. This is an opportunity to learn and discover how we can attract more women in Des Moines since this would be key to growing the business. 
  * It seems that most of the riders tend to utilize the service most heavily from Monday to Friday.  This poses another opportunity to find ways to attract new customers that are just visiting the town for the weekend.

 * Peak Times: 
   * If we are looking at times to have maintenance done on bikes or lower the employee count, we can look at early in the morning or later in the evening.  Our peak times are within 7am - 7pm, which is a clear indication that we would need to have more staff during these hours.

* Checkout Times
  * It looks like we have a most of customers that do take a bike-share for more than an hour.  Generally it's about 40 mins, probably traveling to work or a short destination. We know that most of the bike-shares are unknown, then female come after.

* Summary: 
 * At a high-level, we know most of the NYC bike-sharing are mainly men subscribers.  They are utilizing the bike-sharing for commuting purposes, either going to or from work.  
 
 Additional Visualizations: 
 1. I would visualize the age groups of the gender to see if we would need to boost up marketing campaigns to a certain group or if there's a missing gap within the male population. 
 2. There was a huge spike of "unknown" users, so I would want to visualize where they customers are traveling.  This would help to see if we are looking at actual NY customers or visitors coming for the day. 
 3. Visualize where we can possibilty attract more women in the mix to increase awareness about bike-sharing.  We would need to see where they are less travel trips by gender.
